# hawk-dove-uncertainty
This code refers to simulations of Hawk-Dove games where more and less intelligent agents interact. This project is part of a chapter of my PhD thesis.

The code part must be insert in the dedicated part of NetLogo, while the in the interface part I insert the commands to setup the interface functional to the code. Other plots and monitors are optional.
